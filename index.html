        Mos Def is a hip-hop artist and actor who's known, among other things, for being one half of the '90s duo Black Star. He's appeared in films like 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,' 'Be Kind Rewind,' and The 'Italian Job.'
        Synopsis
        An articulate and intelligent Brooklyn-born rapper who crafted acclaimed socially conscious albums as Mos Def in the late 1990s, he is now known as Yasiin Bey. Arguably, Bey has made more of an impact with his acting and activism than with
        his more recent musical releases. He announced his retirement from music and movies in early 2016 — but at the end of the year he revealed plans to release two more albums in 2017.


        Since his emergence on the national stage in the late 1990s, Mos Def has locked down a reputation as one of the most revered rappers of his generation as well as a highly respected actor. His intelligence, verbal skill and keen eye for
        social observation appeal to people from all walks of life. "My work is a reflection of the human condition," Mos Def says. "I don't want to hurt anybody. I don't want to mislead people. I want to tell the truth. All my songs are not happy.
        Some of them are even aggressive — some may say mean, but we all experience these feelings in life. I'm just being honest about what I feel and what sounds and ideas were motivating me at the time."
